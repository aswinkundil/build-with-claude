However, the solution violates the secondary criterion of being 'compact and concise (under 400 words)' by approximately 150 words.

It exceeds the minimum requirement of 4-5 meals by providing 6 meals/snacks strategically distributed throughout the day. The lactose intolerance restriction is meticulously respected across all meals. The meal plan demonstrates strong nutritional knowledge with appropriate carbohydrate loading for soccer performance and protein distribution for recovery. The only minor concerns are the caloric estimate (which may be slightly conservative depending on training intensity) and lack of explicit training session timing assumptions. These are minor issues that don't violate the stated criteria."
