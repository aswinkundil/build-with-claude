Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the standard architecture for computer vision tasks, with ResNet and VGG variants demonstrating superior performance in image classification benchmarks. Within the broader machine learning paradigm, supervised learning approaches utilizing backpropagation have proven particularly effective for training deep neural networks on large-scale datasets. Furthermore, transfer learning techniques that leverage pre-trained models have significantly reduced computational requirements while improving generalization across diverse visual recognition tasks, from medical imaging to autonomous vehicle perception systems."
