                <td class="prompt-inputs"><strong>content:</strong> Recent advances in deep learning have revolutionized artificial intelligence applications across multiple domains. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the standard architecture for computer vision tasks, with ResNet and VGG variants demonstrating superior performance in image classification benchmarks. Within the broader machine learning paradigm, supervised learning approaches utilizing backpropagation have proven particularly effective for training deep neural networks on large-scale datasets. Furthermore, transfer learning techniques that leverage pre-trained models have significantly reduced computational requirements while improving generalization across diverse visual recognition tasks, from medical imaging to autonomous vehicle perception systems.</td>

It demonstrates strong adherence to secondary criteria by balancing multiple abstraction levels (deep learning, machine learning, CNNs, ResNet, VGG) and avoiding over-granularity. However, there are two minor issues: one omission of an explicitly mentioned concept (large-scale datasets) and one questionable inclusion (autonomous vehicles as a topic rather than just an application context). These are relatively minor deficiencies that don't undermine the overall quality of the extraction.</td>

                <td class="prompt-inputs"><strong>content:</strong> The study of epigenetic mechanisms has revealed how environmental stressors can alter gene expression without changing DNA sequences. Our research examined histone modification patterns in stressed populations, finding elevated levels of H3K27me3 marks associated with chromatin condensation. These findings suggest that nutritional deficiencies, which are prevalent in economically disadvantaged regions, may trigger similar epigenetic responses. Furthermore, the reversibility of these modifications implies potential therapeutic interventions, though the long-term health implications remain unclear and warrant further longitudinal investigation.</td>

                <td class="prompt-inputs"><strong>content:</strong> The integration of carbon pricing mechanisms with ecosystem service valuation presents significant challenges for environmental policy design. Market-based instruments such as cap-and-trade systems have demonstrated efficacy in reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, yet their application to biodiversity conservation remains contested due to difficulties in quantifying non-market values and accounting for ecological tipping points. Simultaneously, payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes in tropical regions have generated revenue for forest conservation while creating new socioeconomic dependencies among smallholder farmers. The heterogeneity of discount rates across stakeholders—where financial institutions prioritize short-term returns while conservation biologists emphasize intergenerational equity—further complicates cost-benefit analyses and regulatory harmonization across jurisdictions.</td>

Regarding secondary criteria, the extraction demonstrates strong understanding of domain concepts and appropriate granularity. The main consideration is whether all distinct topics have been captured—the passage explicitly discusses sulfur dioxide emissions as a concrete example of cap-and-trade success, which could arguably warrant inclusion as a topic. However, this is defensible as an implementation detail rather than a primary topic. The 14 topics extracted are well-chosen and represent the core conceptual landscape of the passage.
