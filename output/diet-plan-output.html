## KEY BENEFITS FOR MUSCLE GAIN
✓ **High protein intake** (2.0g per kg bodyweight) for muscle synthesis  
✓ **Strategic meal timing** around workouts for nutrient utilization  
✓ **Caloric surplus** (400-500 kcal above maintenance) for lean gains  
✓ **Balanced macros** supporting strength and recovery</pre></td>

It successfully delivers 7 meals (exceeding the 4-5 requirement), provides 170g protein, and supports muscle recovery with appropriate carbohydrate and fat distribution. However, the solution violates the secondary criterion of being 'compact and concise (under 400 words)' by approximately 150 words. While the additional content is well-organized and helpful, it contradicts the explicit conciseness requirement. The core meal plan itself is excellent, but the overall presentation exceeds the specified constraints.</td>

## KEY PERFORMANCE BENEFITS
✓ **Optimal carbs for match intensity & recovery**  
✓ **High protein for muscle repair & adaptation**  
✓ **Strategic meal timing around training/matches**  
✓ **100% lactose-free** (almond milk, rice protein)  
✓ **Enhanced glycogen repletion for consecutive-day play**</pre></td>

                <td class="reasoning">The solution fully satisfies all mandatory requirements with clear daily totals, detailed macronutrient percentages, exact portion sizes, and specific meal timings. It exceeds the minimum requirement of 4-5 meals by providing 6 meals/snacks strategically distributed throughout the day. The lactose intolerance restriction is meticulously respected across all meals. The meal plan demonstrates strong nutritional knowledge with appropriate carbohydrate loading for soccer performance and protein distribution for recovery. The only minor concerns are the caloric estimate (which may be slightly conservative depending on training intensity) and lack of explicit training session timing assumptions. These are minor issues that don't violate the stated criteria.</td>
